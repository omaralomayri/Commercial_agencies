## Summary of Findings

I found there was a decrease of number agencies in 2020 compared to 2019, and most of this decrease was in Riyadh and Dammam.  the Chinese agencies were on the top of nationalities in 2019 but for 2020 it decrease to half, leading the American and German agencies to take the lead. Most of these agencies prefer to be in Riyadh and Dammam and to be distribution or commercial type.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I start by introducing the difference between years, followed by top nationalities and their preferred city, then present their types and where these types are placed.
